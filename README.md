# Shrunk in the Wash? Just add water!
2020 N64Brew Game Jam

Hanging up the washing is a neverending hell, even when overnight showers *don't* cause your clothes to inexplicably double in size.
Take advantage of the sunlight to quickly dry your laundry, or play it slow and steady by hanging it inside. But beware, space on the line is running out, new loads of wet laundry are quickly backing up, and your clothes won't stop changing size!
